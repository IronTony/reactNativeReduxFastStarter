React Native Redux Fast Starter
====

This React Native starter is my own React Native starter.

It contains all I need or find useful most of the time in a mobile application.

> Note : this repository is at early stage (*started mid-april 2016*). It will grow up fast (*I want to complete it before starting my new mobile application*).


### UI

- sidemenu (iOS) / drawer (android)
- navigator
- modals
- *... to be completed*
